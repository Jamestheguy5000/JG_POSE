EXPERIMENT DIRECTORY

This directory contains the all files used to perform the script together

Broadly, there are several subdirectories, but the current main ones to pay attention to are

1) multi_person_visuals

This contains the specific visuals that the .py scripts in TEST_SCRIPT_ARYAN work with
These visuals support person tracking, as well as different colors for each person.

This should not be compared to old_multi_vis(no color for diff people), or visuals(single person only)

2) sounds

This directory contains all the sounds that are accessed by the .py script

NOTE: each sound must match the corresponding visual name for the script to work correctly

These sounds are in a .wav format to allow for rich uncompressed audio compared to .mp3

Along with this, you may notice the presence of several .sh scripts present in the directory.
These are helper scripts used to either manipulate, or access sound, or run other experiments.

There are comments through the code for understanding how the pipeline fits together
